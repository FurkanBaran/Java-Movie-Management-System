# Java Movie Management System

This Java application is **my first Java project**, quickly developed over the course of **1-2 days** upon request. It uses a text file as a simple database to manage movie-related data. The application offers a comprehensive set of features for managing movies, stars, and their ratings.

## Features

- **Movie Management**: Users can add new movies to the system. Each movie is stored with unique details such as title, year, length, genre, studio, producer, and a description.
- **Star Management**: The application allows adding stars to movies. Users can search for stars and list all movies associated with a particular star.
- **Rating Management**: Users can add ratings to movies. The application calculates and updates average ratings based on new user input.
- **View Counts**: Functionality to update and track the view counts of movies.
- **Search and Display**: Users can search for movies by star name or movie title. It can also retrieve and display movie posters based on the movie ID.
- **Error Handling**: Provides feedback through dialog boxes if the user inputs invalid data or if no matching records are found.
